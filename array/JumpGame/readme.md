First Solution I wrote was at each encounter how far have reached , marked using a binary array.
In this there was few test cases that i can only reach some place iuf i can actually arrive at that place. 
Further optimisation i did was return true once we have already reached the end of array


I further optimised the space and time complexity of solution using, for space i removed the binary array and just used 
one variable called mxr to denote our maximum reach, this also improved the time complexity as we didnt have to manually mark the array
