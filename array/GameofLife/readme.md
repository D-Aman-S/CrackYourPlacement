This was a straight forward brute force implementation problem, i was able to write the imnplementtaion.

The problem then asked for an in  place solution, which we could definitely achieve in 2 pass by encoding the original array and decoding it. Since int has 4 bits, and only 1 bit is utilized, we can use the other bits to store the answers and at last step we just haver to write shioft it
